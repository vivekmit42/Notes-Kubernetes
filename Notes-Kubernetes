What is kubernetes?
* It is also known as K8s
* It is an open source system used for automating deployment, management of containerized apps, scaling.

What is container orchestration?
* It is a method in which a master will manage various containers roles, its states and their behaviour and operation.

Architecture of K8s:
* When you deploy K8s, you get a cluster.
* Two important parts are:
    ** Master ( Control Plane ) &
    ** Worker Nodes

What is Nodes(Minions)?
* It is a server, in which you running containerised based application.
* In this, we have different components like kube-proxy, container-runtime, kubelet.

What is Cluster?
* Group of nodes

Master
* There is one master who will manage these cluster.
* In this we have various components like API server, scheduler, etcd, control manager.

Different components of Master Node in K8s:
    
    API SERVER:     ** It provide command line interface, thur which we can manage different things in the K8s.
                 
    SCHEDULAR:      ** It is responsible to node to newly created Pods.

    ETCD:           ** It is key-value store, having all cluster data

    CONTROL MANAGER ** It is responsible for managing the state of the cluster.

Different components of Worker Node in K8s:

    KUBELET:        ** It is an agent, make sure containers running in pods.

    Pod:            ** It is Isolated environment, where we can run containers.
                    ** It is smallest unit in K8s.
                    ** A single instance of a running process in a cluster.
                    ** It can run one or more containers and share the same resources.
    
    KUBE-PROXY:     ** It maintains the network rules for comm with pods.

Features of K8s:
    * Container Orchestration
    * Scalability
    * Load Balancing
    * High Availablity
    * Rollouts & Rollback

Installations of K8s:

Step 1. Download & Install kubectl binary with curl on Linux
# curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   138  100   138    0     0    398      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   398
100 54.6M  100 54.6M    0     0  2283k      0  0:00:24  0:00:24 --:--:-- 2306k

Step 2. Validate the binary (optional)
# curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   138  100   138    0     0    399      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   400
100    64  100    64    0     0    163      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   163

Step 3. Validate the kubectl binary against the checksum file:
# echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
kubectl: OK

Step 4. Install kubectl
# install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl

Note:If you do not have root access on the target system, you can still install kubectl to the ~/.local/bin directory:
# chmod +x kubectl
# mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
# mv ./kubectl ~/.local/bin/kubectl

Step 5. Test to ensure the version you installed is up-to-date:
# kubectl version --client

Client Version: v1.32.1
Kustomize Version: v5.5.0

Or use this for detailed view of version:
# kubectl version --client --output=yaml
clientVersion:
  buildDate: "2025-01-15T14:40:53Z"
  compiler: gc
  gitCommit: e9c9be4007d1664e68796af02b8978640d2c1b26
  gitTreeState: clean
  gitVersion: v1.32.1
  goVersion: go1.23.4
  major: "1"
  minor: "32"
  platform: linux/amd64
kustomizeVersion: v5.5.0


Step 6. Installing minikube, Run this command To download the latest minikube stable release on x86-64 Linux using binary download:

# curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-latest.x86_64.rpm
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 45.2M  100 45.2M    0     0   760k      0  0:01:00  0:01:00 --:--:--  300k

Step 7. Run this command To install the latest minikube stable release on x86-64 Linux using binary download:
# sudo rpm -Uvh minikube-latest.x86_64.rpm
Preparing...                          ################################# [100%]

Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/docker.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service.

Step 8. Start your cluster
# minikube start --force
* minikube v1.35.0 on Opensuse-Leap 15.6
! minikube skips various validations when --force is supplied; this may lead to unexpected behavior
* Automatically selected the docker driver. Other choices: ssh, none
* The "docker" driver should not be used with root privileges. If you wish to continue as root, use --force.
* If you are running minikube within a VM, consider using --driver=none:
*   https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/reference/drivers/none/
* Using Docker driver with root privileges
* Starting "minikube" primary control-plane node in "minikube" cluster
* Pulling base image v0.0.46 ...
! minikube was unable to download gcr.io/k8s-minikube/kicbase:v0.0.46, but successfully downloaded docker.io/kicbase/stable:v0.0.46@sha256:fd2d445ddcc33ebc5c6b68a17e6219ea207ce63c005095ea1525296da2d1a279 as a fallback image

  - Using image gcr.io/k8s-minikube/storage-provisioner:v5
* Enabled addons: storage-provisioner, default-storageclass
* Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default

Step 9. Verify whether you have started your cluster or not?
# minikube status
minikube
type: Control Plane
host: Running
kubelet: Running
apiserver: Running
kubeconfig: Configured

Step 10. Interact with your cluster (access your shiny new cluster)
# kubectl get po -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kube-system   coredns-668d6bf9bc-hkdq6           1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   kube-proxy-jgztg                   1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0             13m
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   1 (13m ago)   13m

OR
Alternatively, minikube can download the appropriate version of kubectl and you should be able to use it like this:
 # minikube kubectl -- get po -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS      AGE
kube-system   coredns-668d6bf9bc-hkdq6           1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   etcd-minikube                      1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   kube-apiserver-minikube            1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   kube-controller-manager-minikube   1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   kube-proxy-jgztg                   1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   kube-scheduler-minikube            1/1     Running   0             14m
kube-system   storage-provisioner                1/1     Running   1 (13m ago)   14m

You can also make your life easier by adding the following to your shell config: (for more details see: kubectl)
# alias kubectl="minikube kubectl --"

For additional insight into your cluster state, minikube bundles the Kubernetes Dashboard, allowing you to get easily acclimated to your new environment:
